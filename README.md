Welcome to my game Magus TD!

Main Game UI:
Bottom left of map - The amount of Skill Points you currently have
Bottom right of map - Countdown in seconds until next wave
Top of map - Current wave number
Right of map - Mages available for selection

Controls:
Left click to select mages and place them on the map tiles
"P" or "Escape" key to open up the pause menu
"E" key to end the game, showing the game over menu.

Pause Menu:
Continue - Continues the game
Settings - Opens the settings menu
Restart - Restarts the current level

Settings:
SFX Volume - Adjusts volume for sound effects

How to play:
Defeat waves of enemies by putting down mages!
Defeating enemies will gain you skill points, while letting an enemy go all
the way to your base will reduce your skill points.

You must gain 80 skill points within the amount of waves to complete the level.
If you drop below 0 skill points then it is game over.
